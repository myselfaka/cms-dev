<p>Malala Yousafzai,the Pakistani teenager shot in the head by the Taliban for championing the right of girls to education, has pledged on a visit to Nigeria to help free a group of more than 200 schoolgirls who have been held captive by Islamist militants Boko Haram since April.</p>

<p>The activist, who turns 17 on Monday, held an early birthday celebration with some of the girls who escaped the mass abduction in the north-eastern village of Chibok in April. "I can see those girls as my sisters… and I'm going to speak up for them until they are released," she said during a meeting on Sundaywith some of the parents of the abducted children in the capital, Abuja. "I'm going to participate actively in [the] Bring Back Our Girls campaign to make sure that they return safely." Later, standing beside four visibly delighted children from Chibok, she blew out the candles of a birthday cake.</p><p>

Malala was shot shortly after boarding a school bus in 2009 by Taliban insurgents in Pakistan's Swat district, an event that turned her into a global symbol of defiance against the militants. Similarly, the abduction of 300 secondary school girls has shone a global spotlight on the atrocities of Boko Haram, whose name means "western education is forbidden".</p><p>

A social media campaign, #bringbackourgirls, drew support from Angelina Jolie and Michelle Obama. But attention has since waned, and a small but determined group of relatives who hold daily rallies for the girls say they have been intimidated by the government, which has faced a barrage of negative publicity over its handling of the incident.</p><p>

Meeting a group of parents of the abducted girls, Malala said: "Thank you for your great work and for such courage … you are really brave parents." Some of the parents wiped away tears as she spoke.
</p><p>
Later, parents and four of the girls attended the daily rally in the centre of Abuja, sitting in silence as a crowd chanted. One supporter likened the rallies to a "long battle in which we have faced arrest, intimidation and distractions".
</p><p>
"It's great for Malala to come here and refocus attention on the issue. At the same time, that it took Malala coming to meet our president is an indictment on how Nigeria is handling this crisis," said Toyin, a supporter in her 20s.</p><p>

Shettima Haruna, whose daughter Margaret was abducted, stood up at the rally and addressed the crowd: "We parents thank you all for standing with us all this while. If not for your support, interest would have died down completely. The only reason this case is till receiving attention is through this group."
</p><p>
Another Chibok resident explained why more of the mothers weren't there: "Some of the women are so devastated by the events they can't even cook any more."
</p><p>
Boko Haram's half-decade battle to impose an Islamic caliphate in Africa's most populous nation has become increasingly bloody in the last year. Civilians have increasingly been targeted, and last year the insurgents burning dozens of schoolchildren alive in their dorms. Pakistan and Nigeria have some of the highest numbers of children out of school. In Nigeria, girls make up around two-thirds of the 10.5 million outside the school system.</p><p>

According to Justin Forsyth of Save the Children, which is working in partnership with the Malala Fund, 50 million children living in conflict situations are denied their right to education. "In countries like Syria, South Sudan and Nigeria, schools are targeted in attacks and often used as military bases. Many of the children I've met have told me that one of their top priorities is to return to school," he said.

Global education champion, Malala Yousafzai stipulated this week that she is not a "puppet of the West," and was indeed, a proud Pakistani girl. It needs no introduction that Yousafzai became an international icon for the struggle millions of girls face around the world to access education after she herself was shot in the head by the Taliban. But Malala clarifying her loyalty to her homeland, Pakistan was a well-timed move mainly because the big fat pink elephant in the room is the astounding silence coming from her Pakistani countrymen and countrywomen. "Even if its people hate me," Malala said in an interview to the New York Times, "I will still love it."
</p><p>
One could say that the South-Asian reaction to Malala has more to do with our love of conspiracy theories, and our history than resentment towards what this young girl has come to represent. While the rest of the world views Yousafzai as a champion, Pakistanis for the most part suspect Yousafzai of being a CIA agent out to humiliate their country. As the New York Times describes it, the reaction from people in Pakistan "stems from sensitivity at Western hectoring, a confused narrative about the Taliban and a sense of resentment or downright jealousy."
</p><p>
Personally, I am glad that it was Malala herself that acknowledged her native critics because these days, especially in the West, saying anything bad about this young woman is enough to well, get you shot in the head. But the conversation about what the other half thinks about Yousafzai is needed and warranted, yet difficult to have simply because of the incredible status level this young girl has reached.
</p><p>
In many ways in the West, she has become nothing less than an untouchable icon, beyond the point of criticism or cynicism. The latter is what Pakistanis, and much of the rest of the region view her with because well, we kind of have the right to. CIA spies come in all shapes and sizes in Pakistan, always have and still do. That is just a fact, and the American agency does have a history of using its personnel to gather information clandestinely in the country, even having civil society workers operate undercover for them.
</p><p>
Does all the accolade being thrown Yousafzai's way shed Pakistan in a negative light, as a country that shoots young girls who want to go to school? Yes, of course. It definitely does. And are there people in Malala's violence-stricken village in SWAT who can only dream of being airlifted out of their own living hell, and given the fast-track through British immigration, for themselves and their families? Yes, of course. And does Malala also embody a narrative that makes South Asians confront our colonial past, with the West once again glaring at the East with judging eyes of how backward and uncivilized we apparently are? Yes and yes.</p><p>
But why such a wide gap in how the world loves Malala? The point that it comes to is a basic cultural difference, and that is why I think the international opinion of Yousafzai is so split -- Americans love a good story almost as much as South Asians love a good conspiracy. American journalist, Max Fisher describes in his Washington Post article how the West's response to Malala is actually quite self-indulgent:</p><p>

    The young woman's power as a symbol is undeniable. In the past months, though, the Western fawning over Malala has become... more about our own desire to make ourselves feel warm and fuzzy with a celebrity and an easy message. It's a way of letting ourselves [Americans] off the hook, convincing ourselves that it's simple matter of good guys vs. bad guys, that we're on the right side and that everything is okay.
</p><p>
I think this passage captures where I stand on the Malala story best. I admire and respect her journey: It's incredible and so inspiring. It is. But this level of Western applause, this tendency to over-celebrate anybody from the East is all too familiar, truth be told, and makes me uncomfortable. It also makes it clearer than ever that Yousufzai polarizes her global audience.</p><p>

The undeniable however, is that the special characteristic about Malala, love her or hate her, is that you cannot ignore her story is real. Her plight is real. The Taliban are real, and girls do have to fight to go to school. By surviving an attempted assassination by the Taliban, Malala refused to be a victim, and took the fight for girls education global.</p><p>

But romanticizing Mala's story is not how we resolve what she stands for. If we really want to do her, and her cause justice, let us not only invest in idol-worshipping Yousafzai, but invest in the millions of girls that may remain nameless to us, so that they can go to school.</p><p>

Though they might not be having tea with Queen Elizabeth or chatting with the Obamas, they also want an education. They are all Malala's, too.
